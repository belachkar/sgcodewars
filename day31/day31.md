The more actions, the more time for code execution.
However, if the input number is integer, the results change a little bit. However leading position stays the same.

Vanessa used the simplest and fastest code. The logic is to round a number, then to convert number into string using "{:,}" format(), and finally to remove decimal points for integers.
Congratulations, @Vanessa G.!)
